First: Review Existing Data and Diagram a New Structured Relational Data Model

This is in the ER diagram pdf. 

Second: Write a query that directly answers question(s) from a business stakeholder

This is in the SQL pdf

Third: Choose something noteworthy about the data and share with a non-technical stakeholder

This is in the Third part pdf.
Basically, I just take a look at missing values first and then conduct a RFM analysis to find consumer preference to help understanding data.
